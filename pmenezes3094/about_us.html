            <h5>Who we are</h5>
            <p>
                Architecture is successful when it is functional, practical, beautiful, durable and uniquely suited to its place. We specialize in assisting our clients to achieve the architecture that fits their needs, aspirations, personality, budget, and of course, their unique site.

                <br>

                We are committed to achieving excellence in architectural consulting services. We understand the process of translating the needs of our clients into beautiful and successfully functioning environments. We enthusiastically embrace the challenge of delivering design strategies and project management that responds pragmatically to our client’s requirements. High standards in environmental stewardship are a guiding principle of our practice. As a LEED® Accredited Professional Phillipa strives to craft energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive buildings. We are committed to creating buildings that make a meaningful contribution to the lives of their owners and their community.  
            </p>

            <h5>What we do</h5>
            <p>
                Our speciality is local. Since 2004 our office in the Comox Valley has provided ready access to building sites on Vancouver Island and along the BC coastline. We are familiar with local authorities having jurisdiction, local bylaws, climate and builders. We have a proven track record with commercial, residential and small institutional projects for new construction and renovations. No project is too small to benefit from good design.
            </p>
