        Nicole has lived on Vancouver Island for more than twenty years. Ten years ago she moved to the Comox Valley with her husband and two daughters. She has been on several boards in the Valley, including the Women’s Business Network, Corporate Connections and Today N’ Tomorrow Learning Society. In her spare time, she enjoys traveling and spending time with her family. With 7 years of public practice experience, and after completing her Bachelors of Administration Degree and the Certified General Accountants Program, Nicole started her own practice. She operates her practice from the perspective
        of a small business owner, which gives her the ability to offer practical solutions to her clients.
