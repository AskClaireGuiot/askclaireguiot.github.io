            <p>Architecture is successful when it is functional, practical, beautiful, durable and uniquely suited to its place. We specialize in assisting our clients to achieve the architecture that fits their needs, aspirations, personality, budget, and of course, their unique site.<br>
            Our speciality is local. Since 2004 our office in the Comox Valley has provided ready access to building sites on Vancouver Island and along the BC coastline. We are familiar with local authorities having jurisdiction, local bylaws, climate and builders. We have a proven track record with commercial, residential and small institutional projects for new construction and renovations. No project is too small to benefit from good design.
