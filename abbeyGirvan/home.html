            “We have had the pleasure of working with Nicole and have found her
            to be professional, organized and thorough. We highly recommend her
            to anyone who is looking to have their accounting (taxes, whatever
            you like here) done efficiently and courteously. She got everything
            sorted, schooled me, and made me laugh all for a very competitive
            fee. Can&#39;t beat her. (Plus, she does tons in our community.)”
